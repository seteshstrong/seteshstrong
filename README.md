- 👋 Hi, I’m @seteshstrong
- 👀 I’m interested in FreeBSD and most unix-likes, private cloud deployment in the homelab, exploring digital forensics, and implementing ML whitepapers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can get my hands on, as always.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FreeBSD ports, src, wiki, docs and community development.
- 📫 How to reach me... you can likely find me at my gmail address, with a dot delimiter between my first and last name.
