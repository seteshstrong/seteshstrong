- 👋 Hi, I’m @seteshstrong
- 👀 I’m interested in FreeBSD and most unix-likes, private cloud deployment, digital forensics, and RL agents.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying for CompTIA CySA+. Currently A+, Network+, Security+ and Cloud+ certified, with pending results from the Pentest+ beta.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FreeBSD ports, src, wiki, docs, community development, and interesting cloud/security oriented ML projects.
- 📫 How to reach me... you can likely find me at my gmail address, with a dot delimiter between my first and last name.
